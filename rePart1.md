# Markdown Tutorial Part 1: Regex in General

## What is a Regex?
 Simply a regex is a pattern to match characters or character combinations in a string. They are mainly used to remove characters or ccombinations or to search for them in a given string.

 In Javascript a regex is enclosed with forward slashes like

 <pre lang="js">
 var regularExpression = /[a-z]/;
 </pre> 

they can also be written using object syntax

<pre lang="js">
var regularExpression = new RegExp('a-z');
</pre>
